A technique that minorly improves upon default pill behaviour. 

1. Open mouth, relatively wide. Insert pill on tongue. Place cup on tongue and sip & swallow. Maybe a little more than needed to get pill down.

--   Wait 5 seconds from last swallow to next mouth open
3. Drink water through cup placed with bottom at bottom of bottom front teeth row and drink through lower teeth. Roughly a little more than needed to get pill down. Mouth comfortably open with no effort made to close during drinking.

--   Wait 5 seconds from last swallow to next mouth open
4. Place cup on tongue and sip & swallow. Maybe a little more than needed to get pill down.

--   Wait 5 seconds from last swallow to next mouth open
5. Open mouth modestly wide, and stretch + wiggle tongue modestly once mouth is open. Perform for 3 seconds.

--   Wait 5 seconds from mouth close to next mouth open
6. Place cup on tongue and sip & swallow. Maybe a little more than needed to get pill down.

++ Wait 5-7 seconds between same pill or around 20 between different pills {swallow to mouth open}
